Audio file for the EZcode type in program in the Machine Code for the Absolute Begineer Book - Program (c) 1982 Melbourne House / William Tang / M.A.Sullivan

Typed in by me (Stephen Cooper) - I think i've corrected all the mistakes - audio file was created on a 48k Spectrum, not figured out how to load it on my Next yet and save it as a .bas file!!
